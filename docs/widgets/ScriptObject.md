ScriptObject is an abstract UI type that provides support for scripts, such as `OnLoad`, `OnEvent` and `OnFinished`. Scripts can be set to trigger in response to some widget event, or as a result of user interaction. The specific scripts that are supported vary wildly from object to object, but all objects support setting, hooking and getting of object scripts.

## Methods

---

### ScriptObject:GetScript

Returns the widget's handler function for a script

**Signature:**

```lua
handler = ScriptObject:GetScript("scriptType")
```

**Arguments:**

- `scriptType` - A script type; see [scripts reference](Frame.md#script-handlers) for details (`string`)

**Returns:**

- `handler` - The object's handler function for the script type (`function`)

---

### ScriptObject:HasScript

Returns whether the widget supports a script handler

**Signature:**

```lua
hasScript = ScriptObject:HasScript("scriptType")
```

**Arguments:**

- `scriptType` - A script type; see [scripts reference](Frame.md#script-handlers) for details (`string`)

**Returns:**

- `hasScript` - `1` if the widget can handle the script, otherwise `nil` (`1nil`)

---

### ScriptObject:HookScript

Securely hooks a script handler. Equivalent to [`hooksecurefunc()`](../categories/Secure execution utility.md#hooksecurefunc) for script handlers; allows one to "post-hook" a secure handler without tainting the original.

The original handler will still be called, but the handler supplied will also be called after the original, with the same arguments. Return values from the supplied handler are discarded. Note that there is no API to remove a hook from a handler: any hooks applied will remain in place until the UI is reloaded.

If there was no prior script handler set, then this simply sets the new function as the handler for the script type.

**Signature:**

```lua
ScriptObject:HookScript("scriptType", handler)
```

**Arguments:**

- `scriptType` - Name of the [script](Frame.md#script-handlers) whose handler should be hooked (`string`)
- `handler` - A function to be called whenever the script handler is run (`function`)

---

### ScriptObject:SetScript

Sets the widget's handler function for a script

**Signature:**

```lua
ScriptObject:SetScript("scriptType", handler)
```

**Arguments:**

- `scriptType` - A script type; see [scripts](Frame.md#script-handlers) for details (`string`)
- `handler` - A function to become the widget's handler for the script type (`function`)
